## Connecting to the Owncloud server using a desktop client
You can use the ownCloud Desktop Synchronization client to automatically synchronize your files between the ownCloud server and your local system. The ownCloud Desktop Synchronization client enables you to do the following: 
- Specify one or more directories on your computer that you want to synchronize to the ownCloud server.
- Always have the latest files synchronized, wherever they are located.
### Steps
1. Download the Owncloud Desktop Synchronization client for your operating system from the following location: 
https://owncloud.com/download/#desktop-clients
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the installation wizard. 
3. For connecting to the Owncloud server from the client, perform the following steps:
   - Enter the URL of your ownCloud server in the **Server Address** field. 
   - Click **Next** and enter your ownCloud login.
   - Click **Next**. 
   - On the “Local Folder Option” screen, select to sync all of your files on the ownCloud server or select individual folders. 
   - Click **Connect**.
   
When the client successfully connects to your ownCloud server, the file synchronization begins and you can see the following two options:
- one to connect to your ownCloud Web GUI
